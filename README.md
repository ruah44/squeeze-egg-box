# squeeze-egg-box
### Abstract
This cruft project repurposes an egg box with 6 egg holders into a music instrument inspired by the design of squeeze box in that a player can use one key to play two possible notes and each note corresponds to either opening or closing of the egg box. After adding one extra key as the sharp symbol, each of the rest 5 keys can be used to play 3 or 4 notes. The cruft is built with 5 force resistor sensors, 1 touch sensor as keys and 1 flex sensor attached onto the egg box, connected with arduino uno. A processing sketch creates the visual interface for a fingering chart and the display of triggered notes. It also communicates with the pure data patch to generate the audio output of triggered notes.
